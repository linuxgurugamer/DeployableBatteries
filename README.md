First draft 
=================================================================
Gene walked into the conference room, surveyed the faces and sat down heavily.
He sat for a few seconds, then asked “What’s wrong now?”
Jebediah jumped up.  “Nothing from a piloting point of view.  We landed the science package on Minmus, set it all up, and then returned”
Bill’s turn: “The installation and deployment was nominal, everything was working when we left”.
Gene turned his eyes toward Bob, raised an eyebrow, and just waited
Bob just rolled his eyes.  “Someone forgot that Minmus doesn’t have sun all the time.  The package lost all power when it rotated into night”
Bill started whistling tunelessly.
Bob continued, “and then that same ‘someone’ decided to use different levels of voltage to power everything.  So we can’t even use the batteries available to provide power”
Bill suddenly became very interested in a speck of dirt on the ceiling.
Gene got very red in the face, looked at Bill and simply said, “Well?”
Bill started, and said “Are you talking to me?  Sorry, I wasn’t listening, that spider on the ceiling is making a fascinating web”
If anything, Gene got even redder, took out a manual and threw it with perfect aim at the ceiling.  The SPLAT was very loud in the suddenly very quiet conference room.
“I don’t care how you do it, but the next science package we put out there will have power throughout the night.  Do you understand?”
Bill spluttered “But, the research division has been talking about something called an RTG, claiming it will be available in a few years.  Can’t we just wa..”.
He stopped, looked at Gene’s face, gulped a bit, and said, “I suppose I can make an adapter of some sort.  I’ll have it ready by the next mission’s launch”.

A few days later….

Everyone was again gathered in the conference room.  This time Gene was just sitting with a quizzical expression.  His eyes weren’t rolling.  Yet.
Bill bustled in, pulling a large package behind him.
“It’s ready.  Simply deploy this like everything else.  It will provide power and will recharge if there is enough left over from the solar panels.  It’s the new Deployable Battery, and as a bonus, it will work in a ship as well, if needed.  Well, actually, it really is a regular battery, but I’ve added some extra components to convert it to the new power system.”

Final Draft

There were cheers and pats on the back as the team stode into the briefing room for the post-flight debriefing... It had been a spectacular mission... flawless... perfect.
The team set down in the massive Eastern Crater, set up a new Deployed science camp, and returned without incident...
It was perfect... they thought...
So why, then, did Gene look like his head was about to explode???
"Sit down..."
"What's wrong?" Val whispered nervously...
"What's wrong??? Gene whispered back, then slammed his notes onto the conference table, sending them flying in every direction... "WHAT'S WRONG???"
"I... I don't understand," Bill began...
"Everything was running perfectly," Bob finished
"Yes... yes... everything was running perfectly..." Wernher von Kerman sighed. "Until the sun set and we lost the signal"
"But... but we set it up on the light side on the Mun," Jeb argued. "Not the dark side..."
THUMP.... von Kerman's head hit the table... repeatedly...
"The... thump... Sun... thump... Still... thump... sets... thump... on the light side... THUMP!!!
For a few minutes no-one said a word... until Bob whispered almost imperceptibly... "It was the batteries..."
"What batteries???" Gene sighed...
"Yeah, that's the point... sir..." Bill grumbled. "There were none."
"WHAT???" Gege suddenly howled... "What do you mean... no batteries???
No-one said a word...
"Werhner..." Gene growled...
"It... there... uhhhh.... there was a problem at the last second, and ... well,... uhhh.... we had to switch to a different vendor... sir. " von Kerman stammered... "Zaltonic promised they would be compatable..."
"Zaltonic..." Gene's jaw dropped... "You... you trusted them???  Great... just great!!!"
"I... I can fix this," Wernher started drawing notes on the table... another habit Gene hated. "Yes... yes... I will contact a friend at Ionic Symphonic... She'll should be able to get me the proper materials..."
Werhner stopped and grinned at Gene...
"We can make our own deployable battery packs."
Gene just sighed... How many times was thing going to happen to him??? He was sure this wasn't the last...
"You have 48 hours..."
